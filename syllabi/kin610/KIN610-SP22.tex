\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This class focuses on the introductory statistical techniques used in
social science research. Students will be introduced to concepts such as
reliability, validity, measures of central tendency, variability,
probability, and statistical techniques including: t tests (independent
\& dependent samples), Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Chi-square,
correlation, and regression. Students are expected to take the
material/concepts presented in class and apply them through a series of
homework assignments and quizzes. The overall goal of the course is not
only to help students understand the mathematical/statistical concepts
presented but also to assist in the application of these procedures.

\hypertarget{course-format}{%
\section{Course Format}\label{course-format}}

The format of this course is Traditional face-to-face. However, note

\section{Course Structure and
Requirements}\label{course-structure-and-requirements}}

You are responsible for the material covered in the textbook prior to
attending each class. Please note that the week's readings are specified
in the class schedule (available in Canvas).

In addition to these readings, the instructor may assign supplemental
readings throughout the semester. These supplemental readings do not
appear on the schedule as these readings will be assigned at the
instructor's discretion.

The assignments used to enhance your learning experience in this course
include:

\hypertarget{class-preparedness}{%
\subsection{Class preparedness}\label{class-preparedness}}

You will be evaluated on your preparedness by submitting an assignment
before each class (Major Takeaways). Further details about this
assignment will be provided in Canvas.

\hypertarget{participation-attendance}{%
\subsection{Participation \&
Attendance}\label{participation-attendance}}

Class presence and participation points are given to encourage your
active class participation and discussion. You will be rewarded with a
perfect score \textbf{as long as you frequently come to class and
actively contribute to the class discussion during lectures}.

Although it is not required, most students send their professor a brief
e-mail to explain their absence in advance. Students who repeatedly join
the Zoom session late will have their Class Participation grade lowered.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

Following each class, you will complete a multiple-choice quiz on the
topic covered in class. You will be given three (3) attempts for each
quiz. The final grade for each quiz will be the \textbf{average} of the
three attempts. Quizzes are due every Sunday at 11:59 p.m.

\hypertarget{homeworks}{%
\subsection{Homeworks}\label{homeworks}}

Students will complete three (3) homework assignments in the course of
the semester. The purpose of each assignment is to assist students in
applying their understanding of the statistical procedures discussed in
class as well as to provide an opportunity for students to respond to
the readings.

\begin{quote}
\begin{quote}
NOTE: You are allowed to discuss homework with other students (and with
the instructor), \textbf{but you must write final answers yourself}, in
your own words. \textbf{Solutions prepared ``in committee'' or by
copying or paraphrasing someone else's work are not acceptable}; your
hand-in assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to
\protect\hyperlink{dishonesty}{Academic Dishonesty Policy} for more
information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.
\end{quote}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\subsection{Final Project}\label{final-project}}

You will be required to complete and submit a final project at the end
of the semester. In short, you will be given a research question and a
data set. Then, you will be asked to run the proper statistical analysis
in \protect\hyperlink{supplies}{Jamovi} and turn in a written report.
\textbf{In addition, you will be required to present the results of your
project to your classmates}. Further information about this assignment
will be provided in Canvas.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Note 1}: In recognition of the fact that grading, however
carefully done, will always be imperfect, this class will utilize a
``round up'' rule for assigning final grades. I will round up from .5\%
and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5
will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\emph{Note 2}: Requests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to
\href{https://bit.ly/3bDxwZi}{university policies}. Among other
requirements, ``I'' is possible only for instances in which you are
demonstrating passing work in the class.
\end{quote}

\end{quote}

Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class; please, plan
accordingly.

\hypertarget{e-mail-policy}{%
\subsection{E-mail Policy}\label{e-mail-policy}}

If you have a question concerning this course (i.e., assignments,
content, deadlines, etc.), send a message\footnote{When referring to an
  assignment, open it online, copy its URL address, and include it as
  part of your question. Students may also answer questions that are
  sent to our mailing list.} to our mailing list (provide under
Canvas\textgreater Home). For any other matters, send me a message at my
CSUN email.

I am usually quick to respond to student e-mails. Below, I outline why I
will not respond to certain e-mails students send. Multiple rationales
follow.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the syllabus.
\item
  The student is protesting a grade without reference to specific points
  of objection. These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part
  of the student and do not require a response from me. Students
  interested in improving their knowledge of material should see me
  during office hours.
\item
  The student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which the
  syllabus already established the deadline. The answer is always
  ``no''; unless you have a reason that can be documented and you
  contacted me before the deadline.
\item
  The student is asking for an extra credit opportunity, a request that
  amounts to more grading for the professor. The answer is ``no''.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{More e-mail stuff\ldots{}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you need to schedule an online meeting via Zoom
  (\url{https://csun.zoom.us/}), you can do so by visiting this link:
  \url{http://calendly.com/drfurtado}. The details will be provided when
  the meeting is scheduled via Calendly, including the option to
  cancel/reschedule a meeting, if needed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{make-up-exam-policy}{%
\subsection{Make-Up Exam Policy}\label{make-up-exam-policy}}

There is no make-up for assignments. Therefore, unless you have
discussed your situation with me before the assignment's due date and we
have made other arrangements, a missed assignment results in a grade of
zero (see late assignment below). \textbf{Note that making
``arrangements'' will only be possible given the student provides a
valid and written excuse from a reputable source}.

\hypertarget{late-assignments}{%
\subsection{Late Assignments}\label{late-assignments}}

Unless you have made previous arrangements, a late assignments will be
docked 10\% per day (first 4 days) it is late. After the fourth day, it
will result in a grade of zero.

\hypertarget{extra-credit}{%
\subsection{Extra Credit}\label{extra-credit}}

There is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to
make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra
credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will
be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.

\hypertarget{disabilities-policy}{%
\subsection{Disabilities Policy}\label{disabilities-policy}}

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level
to qualified students with disabilities.

This instructor, in conjunction with California State University
Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

If you are a student with a disability and wish to request
accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities
Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818)
677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability
will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early
planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as
possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely
manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.

\hypertarget{dishonesty}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty Policy}\label{dishonesty}}

\emph{Please, \textbf{stop} and read the information below; this is
important!}

Each student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the
conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with
emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic
Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any
student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication,
facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline,
which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject
to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to
visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student
Conduct.

\url{http://www.csun.edu/a\&r/soc/studentconduct.html}

\hypertarget{about-plagiarism}{%
\subsubsection{About Plagiarism}\label{about-plagiarism}}

Plagiarism means using words, ideas, or arguments from another person or
source without citation\footnote{Except for Homeworks. your hand-in
  assignments must represent your own thoughts (refer to
  \protect\hyperlink{dishonesty}{Academic Dishonesty Policy} for more
  information); especially, the information about PLAGIARISM.}. Cite all
sources consulted to any extent (including material from the internet),
whether or not assigned and whether or not quoted directly. For
quotations, four or more words used in sequence must be set off in
quotation marks, with the source identified.

Plagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code.
Please read my comment about plagiarism under
\protect\hyperlink{homeworks}{Homeworks}. Any form of cheating will
immediately earn you a failing grade for the entire course. \textbf{By
remaining enrolled, you consent to this policy}.

\begin{quote}
Turnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every
submission against a database of papers, as well as against the
Internet.
\end{quote}

What is Turnitin?

\href{https://www.turnitin.com/}{Turnitin} is an automated system that
instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student's
assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of
student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be
expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in
electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor,
I receive a report from \emph{Turnitin} that states if and how another
author's work was used in the assignment.
