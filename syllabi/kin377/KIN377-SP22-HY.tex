This course consists of readings, written assignments, weekly responses,
and check-ins on our Canvas page.

\hypertarget{hybrid-oh}{%
\subsection{Hybrid (OH)}\label{hybrid-oh}}

This is a Hybrid class (OH) in which students attend class sessions on
campus and in an online environment. The class typically meets
approximately half online and half on campus.

In addition,

\begin{quote}
This course is not self-paced and is not the ``softer, easier way''!
This means that you have to \textbf{1) check in regularly and 2) respond
to the weekly assignments.}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{are-you-ready-to-learn-online}{%
\subsection{Are you ready to learn
online?}\label{are-you-ready-to-learn-online}}

Online learning is often described as ``harder than expected.'' This is
due to the unique nature of online classes. If this is your first online
class, please take a moment to click the link below and assess your
readiness to succeed online. The survey is informational only and will
not be required for enrollment. However, it can be used to understand
the kind of commitment that is necessary for success in online learning.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  You are enrolled in a course which is part of the myCSUNDigitalAccess
  (MCDA) program.
\item
  The \emph{MCDA} program provides digital materials to students at a
  deeply discounted price.
\item
  Some or all of your materials for this course are being provided
  digitally through the \emph{MCDA} program.
\item
  ALL enrolled students will have access to the materials through Canvas
  by the 1st day of class, but more likely earlier.
\item
  If you want to keep access throughout the semester, you need do
  nothing. A charge will be placed on your CSUN student portal account
  (just like tuition, but a separate charge) around the 5th or 6th week
  of classes. You will then be responsible for paying the university.
\item
  If you choose to obtain your materials elsewhere you have until
  FRIDAY, \textbf{2/11/22} to Opt-Out (see instructions below). Those
  who Opt-Out by \textbf{2/11/22} will lose access and will \textbf{not
  be charged}.
\item
  Anyone who does not Opt-Out by the \textbf{2/11/22} deadline will be
  charged and those charges \textbf{will not be reversible}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{opt-out-instructions.}{%
\paragraph{Opt-out Instructions.}\label{opt-out-instructions.}}

If you wish to opt out of this program and not purchase access to the
required digital materials you will need to follow the steps below by
\textbf{2/11/22}:

\hypertarget{access-to-computer-internet}{%
\subsection{Access to Computer \&
Internet}\label{access-to-computer-internet}}

Although not required, it is suggested that you have access to a
computer (not simply a tablet and/or smartphone) and Internet throughout
this course. Note that CSUN students are eligible to
\href{https://www.csun.edu/it/device-loaner-program}{check out tech
devices from CSUN at NO COST}.

\hypertarget{mini-juggling-balls}{%
\subsection{Mini Juggling Balls}\label{mini-juggling-balls}}

One of the requirements of this course is to learn a motor skill. If you
select juggling, it's suggested you use \href{http://goo.gl/X3EjLE}{mini
juggling balls}. Or you can use a similar object at your disposal.

\hypertarget{speed-stacks-sport-stacking-set}{%
\subsection{Speed Stacks Sport Stacking
Set}\label{speed-stacks-sport-stacking-set}}

If you choose to learn the cup stacking, I recommend you to acquire the
\href{http://goo.gl/Y8HXt5}{cups used in national and international
tournaments}, or grab a set of less expensive ones from Amazon or
elsewhere.

\begin{quote}
DO NOT USE ORDINARY PLASTIC CUPS WHEN PRACTICING AS THEY ARE NOT
DESIGNED FOR CUP STACKING. These cups will significantly affect your
performance and your grade, in case you choose cup stacking as your
learning task.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{course-policy}{%
\section{Course Policy}\label{course-policy}}

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat
and try to learn stuff.

\hypertarget{grading-policy}{%

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{25\%}: Weekly Quizzes {[}SLO's 1{]}.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Note 1}: In recognition of the fact that grading, however
carefully done, will always be imperfect, this class will utilize a
``round up'' rule for assigning final grades. I will round up from .5\%
and above, but anything below this will round down. In other words, 79.5
will round up to 80, while 79.4 will round down to 79 even.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\emph{Note 2}: Requests for an Incomplete (I) must conform to
\href{https://bit.ly/3bDxwZi}{university policies}. Among other
requirements, ``I'' is possible only for instances in which you are
demonstrating passing work in the class.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{attendance-policy}{%
\subsection{Attendance Policy}\label{attendance-policy}}

\begin{quote}
\emph{Showing up is 80 percent of life} -- Woody Allen,
\href{http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/\#note-6553-1}{via

\end{quote}

Although this is an online course, ``attendance'' is crucial. And by
that I mean: check in Canvas several times a week.

\hypertarget{e-mail-policy}{%
\subsection{E-mail Policy}\label{e-mail-policy}}

If you have a question concerning this course (i.e., assignments,
content, deadlines, etc.), send a message\footnote{When referring to an
  assignment, open it online, copy its URL address, and include it as
  part of your question. Students may also answer questions that are
  sent to our mailing list.} to our mailing list (provide under
Canvas\textgreater Home). For any other matters, send me a message at my
CSUN email.

Keep it in mind:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All students enrolled in my courses are added to the mailing lists
  automatically. If you are not receiving emails from the mailing
  address, then contact CSUN Help Desk to get it fixed.
\item
  Only send messages to the mailing list address when the content is
  pertinent to ALL students. For private matters, email me directly.
\item
  ONLY send message to the mailing list address from your CSUN email
  address; otherwise, your message will not be delivered.
\end{enumerate}

I am usually quick to respond to student e-mails. Below, I outline why I
will not respond to certain e-mails students send. Multiple rationales
follow.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the syllabus.
\item
  The student is protesting a grade without reference to specific points
  of objection. See the policy on protesting a grade in the syllabus.
  These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part of the student
  and do not require a response from me. Students interested in
  improving their knowledge of material should see me during office
  hours.
\item
  The student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which the
  syllabus already established the deadline. The answer is always
  ``no''; unless you have a reason that can be documented and you
  contacted me before the deadline.
\item
  The student is asking for an extra credit opportunity, a request that
  amounts to more grading for the professor. The answer is ``no''.
\end{enumerate}

More e-mail stuff\ldots{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you need to schedule an online meeting via Zoom
  (\url{https://csun.zoom.us/}), you can do so by visiting this link:
  \url{http://calendly.com/drfurtado}. Details will be provided when the
  meeting is scheduled via Calendly, including the option to
  cancel/reschedule a meeting, if needed.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{make-up-exam-policy}{%
\subsection{Make-Up Exam Policy}\label{make-up-exam-policy}}

There is no make-up for assignments. Therefore, unless you have
discussed your situation with me before the assignment's due date and we
have made other arrangements, a missed assignment results in a grade of
zero (see late assignment below). \textbf{Note that making
``arrangements'' will only be possible given the student provides a
valid and written excuse from a reputable source}.

\hypertarget{late-assignments}{%
\subsection{Late Assignments}\label{late-assignments}}

Unless you have made previous arrangements, a late assignments will be
docked 10\% per day (first 4 days) it is late. After the fourth day, it
will result in a grade of zero.

\hypertarget{extra-credit}{%
\subsection{Extra Credit}\label{extra-credit}}

There is no individual extra credit granted. Therefore, do not plan to
make-up poor grades at the end of the semester by asking to do extra
credit work. I might provide extra credit opportunities, but these will
be offered to the entire class, not to individuals.

\hypertarget{badges}{%
\subsubsection{Badges}\label{badges}}

You will be able to collect several badges while taking this course. You
can exchange these badges for extra points. Note that the extra points
can only be used for assignments under the Online Discussion category.

\hypertarget{disabilities-policy}{%
\subsection{Disabilities Policy}\label{disabilities-policy}}

Federal law mandates the provision of services at the university-level
to qualified students with disabilities.

This instructor, in conjunction with California State University
Northridge, is committed to upholding and maintaining all aspects of the
federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

If you are a student with a disability and wish to request
accommodations, please contact the office of Students with Disabilities
Resources located in 110 Student Services Building, or call (818)
677-2684 for an appointment. Any information regarding your disability
will remain confidential. Because many accommodations require early
planning, requests for accommodations should be made as early as
possible. Any requests for accommodations will be reviewed in a timely
manner to determine their appropriateness to this setting.

\hypertarget{academic-dishonesty-policy}{%
\subsection{Academic Dishonesty
Policy}\label{academic-dishonesty-policy}}

\emph{Please, \textbf{stop} and read the information below; this is
important!}

Each student is expected to be familiar with, and abide by, the
conditions of student conduct, as presented in the CSUN Catalog, with
emphasis on sections entitled, Student Conduct Code, Academic
Dishonesty, Faculty Policy on Academic Dishonesty, and Penalties. Any
student engaging in academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, fabrication,
facilitating academic dishonesty, plagiarism) is subject to discipline,
which may include a failing grade in the course, and may also be subject
to more severe discipline by the University. Students are encouraged to
visit the link below and become familiar with the Standards for Student
Conduct.

\url{http://www.csun.edu/a\&r/soc/studentconduct.html}

\hypertarget{reflection-paper-submission}{%
\subsubsection{Reflection Paper
Submission}\label{reflection-paper-submission}}

Plagiarism is a serious violation of the CSUN Student Conduct Code. Be
aware that \textbf{borrowing} a paper from a student who completed this
course previously and writing your paper based on that student's paper
will be considered \textbf{PLAGIARISM}.

\begin{quote}
Turnitin (see below) will detect such misconducts as it checks every
submission against a database of papers, as well as against the
Internet.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Penalties: If caught, the student will receive a letter grade of ``F''
on BOTH the Reflection Paper and the Video Performance assignments, in
which case the student will likely fail the course as these two
assignments account for 40\% of the course total grade.
\end{quote}

What is Turnitin?

You should be aware that the Reflection Paper will be submitted via
Canvas, which is connected to
\href{https://www.turnitin.com/}{Turnitin}. This is an automated system
that instructors can use to quickly and easily compare each student's
assignment with billions of websites, as well as an enormous database of
student papers that grows with each submission. Accordingly, you will be
expected to submit assignments through the Canvas Assignment Tool in
electronic format. After the assignment is processed, as an instructor,
I receive a report from \emph{Turnitin} that states if and how another
author's work was used in the assignment.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

To succeed in this course, you will be required to complete several
assignments. To avoid surprises, be proactive and review these
assignments.

Provided below are general information on each assignment. More detailed
information on each assignment can be found on our Canvas page.

\hypertarget{quizzes}{%
\subsection{Quizzes}\label{quizzes}}

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and will assess the student's
understanding of the topic covered each week. Students are allowed to
utilize class notes and the course text to answer the questions;
however, \textbf{collaboration with other students is not allowed}. The
penalty for academic dishonesty is a 0 on the assignment, possibly
failure in the class, and possible dismissal from the
program/university.

\emph{Here are some other useful information about quizzes:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  When taking the quizzes, questions will appear one at a time and
  locked after being answered. This means that you are not allowed to go
  back and review your answers after answering each question.
\item
  Correct answers will only be shown to students after the deadline of
  each quiz.
\item
  Refer to Canvas for due dates. Here is a word of advice about weekly
  quizzes: avoid waiting until the ``last minute'' to take them. Taking
  the quizzes earlier will give you enough time to troubleshoot
  potential technical problems. Quizzes will NOT be reopened after the
  due dates. Therefore, plan accordingly.
\item
  You will be given a \textbf{single} attempt on each quiz. This means
  you need to study the material before taking each quiz. All quizzes
  are timed. You will have 20 minutes to finish and submit a quiz.
\item
  A quiz will only start if the student has a JavaScript-enabled
  web-browser. Contact \href{https://www.csun.edu/it}{CSUN IT} should
  you run into technical issues when taking quizzes.
\item
  Once opened, a quiz will appear in a full-screen pop-up window that
  covers all the other windows and has no navigation control
\item
  It should be noted that the content of each quiz belongs to
  \href{https://www.mheducation.com/}{McGraw Hill} (the publisher of our
  text). Therefore, federal copyright laws prohibit the dissemination of
  this material. It includes, but is not limited to, posting the quiz
  online and/or sharing the quiz with someone outside of the classroom.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{online-discussions}{%
\subsection{Online Discussions}\label{online-discussions}}

You will be required to complete several online discussions while taking
this course. The details about each discussion topic will be provided on
Canvas. Typically, there are two deadlines for this assignment. First,
you need to answer the question I post (deadline 1), then respond to
your classmates' posts (deadline 2). Refer to our Class Schedule in
Canvas.

\hypertarget{learning-task-performance-reflection-paper}{%
\subsection{Learning Task Performance \& Reflection
Paper}\label{learning-task-performance-reflection-paper}}

\emph{Refer to Canvas for full requirements, but basically:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  You will be asked to choose either the 3-object Juggling or Cup Speed
  Stacking activity;
\item
  Then, you will be required to practice and learn the selected
  activity;
\item
  Before the end of the term (see Calendar for deadlines), you will be
  asked to video-record yourself performing the skill you have learned.
  This is the \textbf{Performance} portion of this assignment and
  accounts for 20\% of the final grade;
\item
  The 2nd part of this assignment is a \textbf{Reflection Paper}, which
  also accounts for 20\% of the final grade. As you practice and learn
  the selected skill, you will be advised to use the Motor Learning
  Principles (full details on Canvas) you will be exposed to while
  taking this course.
\item
  Throughout the term, you will be required to update me on your
  progress toward learning the selected skill (juggling or cup
  stacking). See Learning Task Updates below.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{learning-task-updates}{%
\subsection{Learning Task Updates}\label{learning-task-updates}}

You will be submitting several updates throughout the term. These
``updates'' are meant to keep you on track and ensure you are taking
advantages of all the learning techniques covered in this course to
master the selected skill. More information about this assignment will
be provided on Canvas.

\subsection{What I Expect of You:}\label{what-i-expect-of-you}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Online classes are deceiving. Many times new online learners expect
  them to be easier than face-to-face classes and are surprised to learn
  how time intensive they are.
\item
  Plan your schedule to ensure you have approximately 10 hours per week
  to spend on this class and take time to identify where and when you'll
  do your learning.
\item
  Review the due dates for the assignments (see Calendar) to orient
  yourself to the flow of the learning. 4. This course requires regular
  engagement throughout each week. Plan to reserve a few hours each day
  to practice the skill you selected for the Learning Task assignment.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{online-etiquette}{%
\subsection{Online Etiquette}\label{online-etiquette}}

All learners in this course will expect to abide by our community ground
rules (see below).

Ground Rules: In an effort to ensure our learning community develops,
thrives and sustains throughout our time together, the following ground
rules will be in effect at all times.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider yourself a member of a community. A community is a group of
  individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We
  are working together to support the successful achievement of our
  learning outcomes.
\item
  Log-in and participate regularly to group conversations and
  activities.
\item
  Treat the diverse contributions made by other community members with
  respect.
\item
  Have patience and a sense of humor with technology.
\item
  Be a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may
  challenge your perceptions.
\item
  Ask for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.
\item
  Understand that communications shared through text have a higher
  likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken.
  Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully
  before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it
  out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it's phrased,
  rewrite it.
\item
  Contribute regularly to group dialogue, including discussion posts and
  replies. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the
  collective strength and diversity of our community.
\item
